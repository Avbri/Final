This map highlights the change (or lack thereof) of the federal minimum wage over the last 15 years. While states have the authority to require employers to pay wages above the federal minimum (currently still $7.25), not all states choose to do so.
The data from this map came from the website Open Secrets. While not all data was available, this map displays a senator from each state within the United States and their estimated net worth in the year 2018. More can be found about how these net worths were calculated in Open Secret's methodology pages. 
The plan for this site was to additionally display the number of years it would take a minimum wage worker to accumulate the same net worth as their senate representative. trouble with features and data formatting from original .geojson file proved difficult. This calculation is still visible within the "pointswages.geojson" file, and divides the networth (NETMAX) by the states's minimum wage and divided again by 2080 hours. If a minimum wage worker worked 40 hours a week, for all 52 weeks of the year, the time it would take to acquire the wealth some senators have may be surprising. 

Introduced in 2023, Senate bill S.2488 has not undergone any actions since July 23, 2023. On July 24, 2024, one year and one day later, NPR published this article:[text](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/24/nx-s1-5050573/federal-minimum-wage-increase-15-year-anniversary).
